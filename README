liby4m

A library for reading the yuv4mpeg2 file format. I couldn't find one that suited my needs, so I made one.

Goal:
I found the y4m file format really useful for moving around uncompressed video, seeing
as it can still be used by other programs without having to memorize
and specify the dimensions and colour space to each of those programs.

So I created this library with the goal of allowing the easy creation of small
programs that can use the y4m file format. I was experimenting with OpenCL
and wanted to process video frames, which was the initial intention.

Using the library:
Well, the Makefile is probably pretty self-explanatory. Just run it and
it will create a bin directory with an so file which you can link to.
I don't have an install target in the makefile. I think the ultimate
solution to that is to use Cmake to create the Makefile. I started trying
and then...got kind of bored, so it's just the Makefile for right now.

The test directory:
There's a test directory that shows potential use of the library.
It was what I used to test the library during development, so the
code is necessarily simplistic and has some commented out parts.
The code sometimes makes direct use of the y4mFile_t structure,
and ideally code shouldn't be doing that for future proofing.
If you need access to one of the parameters that doesn't have a
getter, then write one!
