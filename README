liby4m

A library for reading the yuv4mpeg2 file format. I couldn't find one that suited my needs, so I made one.

Goal:
I found the y4m file format really useful for moving around uncompressed video, seeing
as it can still be used by other programs without having to memorize
and specify the dimensions and colour space to each of those programs.

So I created this library with the goal of allowing the easy creation of small
programs that can use the y4m file format. I was experimenting with OpenCL
and wanted to process video frames, which was the initial intention.

Using the library:
Standard cmake usage:
mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake ..
make
make install #this will install to the cmake prefix

The test directory:
There's a test directory that shows potential use of the library.
It was what I used to test the library during development, so the
code is necessarily simplistic and has some commented out parts.
The code sometimes makes direct use of the y4mFile_t structure,
and ideally code shouldn't be doing that for future proofing.
If you need access to one of the parameters that doesn't have a
getter, then write one!
Also, the test folder is more of a development testbed as opposed
to a formal test suite, which I should also look into creating.
